# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Setup

### pip install flask

cd into the api folder and install the flask package using pip.
If running into issues with setup, follow this [link](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-create-a-react--flask-project?fbclid=IwAR3QNAQMmNOiAsXsJ9pmDHOiTUKXceg-qJHqHLFhP2bzSxoGnNxNYeS9Y_I)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
(Note: you will need to run both the UI and API)

### `yarn dev`

Runs the UI and the API in development modes. It will call the yarn start-ui and
yarn start-api commands together.

To stop them running, will need to click ctrl C (^C) twice, once for each instance
running.

Note: To make this function call available, you will need to install concurrently:
`npm install -g concurrently`

### `yarn start-ui`

Runs the UI in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start-api`

Runs the API in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://locahost:5000) to view it in the
browser. Note: should be seeing a "404 Not Found"

The page will not reload if you make edits. You will need to re-run.\

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
